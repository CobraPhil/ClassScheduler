# Manual Pattern Inference Fix

## Problem Summary

The user reported that `BTOT 308 P Major Prophets` had:
- **Session 1**: `Open/Open/Open` (should be auto-scheduled)  
- **Session 2**: `Tuesday/Period 5/Classroom 5` (manually scheduled)

The class requires 2 sessions total (8-credit class), so the open session should have been auto-scheduled. However:
- The open session was **NOT scheduled**
- **NO error message** was shown to the user

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Manual Pattern Inference Logic Flaw

In `analyze_manual_session_pattern()` method (lines 428-450), the system would infer day patterns based on manual sessions. For 8-credit classes:

```python
if 'Tuesday' in manual_days:
    pattern['inferred_days'] = ['Tuesday', 'Thursday']  # WRONG!
```

**Problem**: The inferred pattern included the manually used day (`Tuesday`), causing conflicts.

### 2. Preferred Day Selection Logic Flaw  

In the auto-scheduling logic (lines 1215-1218), when only 1 session remained:

```python  
if manual_pattern['preferred_day'] and remaining_sessions_needed == 1:
    day_options = [[manual_pattern['preferred_day']]]  # WRONG!
```

**Problem**: It tried to use the same day as the manual session (`Tuesday`).

### 3. Scheduling Failure Chain

1. System infers `['Tuesday', 'Thursday']` as the pattern
2. Tries to schedule the open session on `Tuesday` (preferred day)
3. Hits conflicts because Tuesday is already taken by the manual session:
   - Teacher conflict (same teacher, same time)
   - Student conflicts (same students, same time) 
   - Room conflict (Classroom 5 already taken)
4. Scheduling fails but no error shown because it's auto-scheduling, not manual

## The Fix

### 1. Fixed Pattern Inference (`analyze_manual_session_pattern`)

**Before**: Inferred the full pattern including used days
```python
if 'Tuesday' in manual_days:
    pattern['inferred_days'] = ['Tuesday', 'Thursday']  # Includes used day!
```

**After**: Infers only the REMAINING days needed
```python  
if 'Tuesday' in manual_days:
    pattern['inferred_days'] = ['Thursday']   # Only remaining day needed
```

### 2. Fixed Day Selection Logic

**Before**: Used preferred day (which was the manual day)
```python
if manual_pattern['preferred_day'] and remaining_sessions_needed == 1:
    day_options = [[manual_pattern['preferred_day']]]  # Wrong day!
```

**After**: Always uses inferred days first (which excludes manual days)
```python
if manual_pattern['inferred_days']:
    day_options = [manual_pattern['inferred_days']]  # Correct remaining days
```

### 3. Comprehensive Coverage

The fix handles all frequency patterns:

**8-credit classes (2 sessions)**:
- `Tuesday` manual → `Thursday` auto  
- `Monday` manual → `Wednesday` auto
- `Wednesday` manual → `Monday` auto

**12-credit classes (3 sessions)**:
- `Monday` manual → `Wednesday, Friday` auto (complete M/W/F)
- `Monday, Wednesday` manual → `Friday` auto (complete M/W/F)
- `Tuesday` manual → `Wednesday, Thursday` auto (complete T/W/Th)

## Verification

The fix was verified with direct testing:

```
✅ PASS: Correctly inferred Thursday as complement to manually scheduled Tuesday
✅ PASS: Manual days correctly contains Tuesday: ['Tuesday']  
✅ PASS: No overlap between manual days ['Tuesday'] and inferred days ['Thursday']
```

## Expected Behavior Now

For `BTOT 308 P Major Prophets`:
1. **Session 2** (manual): Already scheduled on `Tuesday Period 5`
2. **Session 1** (open): Will now be auto-scheduled on `Thursday` (or another available day if Thursday conflicts)
3. **No conflicts**: The auto-scheduler will avoid using Tuesday since it's already taken
4. **Success**: Both sessions will be scheduled successfully
5. **No error**: User should see the complete schedule without warnings

## Impact

This fix resolves scheduling failures for any class that has:
- Mixed manual and open sessions
- Where the manual pattern inference was incorrectly constraining auto-scheduled sessions
- Affecting 8-credit and 12-credit classes with partial manual assignments
